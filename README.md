# Steadystateconc

This software, named Steadystateconc, is a software program for calculating true steady-state metabolite
concentrations by the Runge-Kutta method and the S-system method.

The detailed information will be available in the paper: (A. Miyawaki-Kuwakado, S..Komori, and F. Shiraishi, “A Promising Method for Calculating True Steady-State
Metabolite Concentrations in Large-Scale Metabolic Reaction Network Models”).
